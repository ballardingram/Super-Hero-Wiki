# Super Hero Wiki
This is a group project for our Interactive Front End Web Site. We created a Super Wiki that uses two (2) APIs to provide users a comic book experience in finding their favorite superhero's backstory and movie list.

## Built With
This website was built with the standard structure of HTML, CSS, and JS files all referenced appropriately. We pulled from JQUERY, Tailwind, Google Fonts, Marvel API, and Movie API for the content. We used VS Code, the DOM, and Web Developer Tools to write and edit the code.

## Website

The group worked well together to delegate task and reduce time spent on design and API choice. This afforded us more time to focus on the Javascript and API functions that made the website functional.
